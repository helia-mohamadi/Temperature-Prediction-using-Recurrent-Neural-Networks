# Temperature-Prediction-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks

In this exercise, our goal is to predict future temperatures based on past temperature data. We'll use a dataset containing historical temperature records for this purpose.

### Steps
1. **Download Dataset**: Download the dataset from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/weather-prediction/data))].
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as normalization on the dataset.
3. **RNN Training**: Train an RNN model on the preprocessed dataset.
4. **Temperature Prediction**: Use the trained RNN model to predict temperatures for the next 7 days based on the last 30 days' data.

### Example
Include a brief example showcasing the performance of the RNN model in predicting future temperatures based on past data.
